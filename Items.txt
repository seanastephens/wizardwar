In Wizard Wars, your units can pick up 6 different items, each of which 
increases a different attribute of that unit. The items are displayed in 
the status pop up that is displayed when you click on each unit on the map. 
The different items include the attack potion, defense potion, energy potion, 
health potion, mana potion, traps, and the flag in the capture the flag game mode.
You can use an item by right clicking when a unit is selected. The potions will increase
the units attributes while the trap causes that unit to not be able to move or attack for 
next turn.
