Wizard Wars is a turn-based tactical role playing game. 
The goal of the game depends on the game type. In death match, the 
objective is to kill all of the units of the opposing player. This can be
done by attacking the other team's players units during your turn. 
In capture the flag, the goal of the game is to capture the flag and bring it to the
home base. You may capture the flag by having a unit move to the square that the
flag contains and the flag will then be automatically picked up as an item. You can
see that a unit has the flag by clicking on the unit and viewing the icon in the unit's
status bar. If the unit carrying the flag is killed, the flag spawns at the position
where the unit died. In Zombies, the computer spawns more tanks after each one of your turn.
