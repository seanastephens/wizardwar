# How to write a map_file:

# The first line should be:

NUMBER_OF_ROWS=X

# Where X is the number of rows (in other words the height of 
# the map).The second line should be:

NUMBER_OF_COLS=Y

# Where Y is the number of coluns (in other words the width of 
# the map). After the first two lines, put a comma-separated
# list of tile types. For example, if NUMBER_OF_ROWS=4 and 
# NUMBER_OF_COLS=3, the following might follow:

Wall,Wall,Wall
Grassland,Grassland,Wall
Hill,Hill,Hill,
Grassland,Base,Base
