To make git remember your password for a while (linux, might work on windows):

    git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=<numberOfSeconds>"

/*
 * Below may not apply to you all because I was the one that set up the repo.
 */

If you do

    git branch --set-upstream master origin/master

Then you can just do

    git pull    // or push!

instead of 

    git pull origin master
