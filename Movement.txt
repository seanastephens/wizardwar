Movement in Wizard Wars is done based on whether it is your turn or not. 
If it is your turn, move a unit by clicking on the unit to select it and then clicking on a tile 
on the map that is not occupied by another unit. If that tile is within your allowable move 
range, an orange arrow will display the potential move. If you are unsatisfied with the move simply select
that unit again and click on a different unoccupied tile. Attack moves are done the same way: simply select
a unit and click on an tile occupied by an enemy unit. If that tile is within your allowable attack range,
a red line should display the potential attack. If you are unsatisfied with the move simply select
that unit again and click on a different tile occupied by an enemy. Click on the green end turn button to cause
these movements to occur and to end your turn.
