In Wizard Wars, you can form an army made up of up to 6 different
types of units: wizards, scouts, archers, swordsman, artillery, and ogres. 
Each unit has a different range of movement and attributes
including attack strength and defense strength. When a unit is selected and it 
is your turn, you will be able to see the tiles that the unit can move to as well 
as its attack range. Each unit has its own image and animations. Some units may be 
better for different game modes as well as different game situations.
